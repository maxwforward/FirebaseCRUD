# Firebase Realtime Database CRUD Operations

This application can perform all of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on a Firebase Realtime Database.  

To use it, clone this repository, then open the folder in Visual Studio Code.  Once the folder is open in Visual Studio Code, open the firebaseDriver.py file, right-click in the file, and select "Run Python File in Terminal"

You will then be prompted to enter a database URL.  This is the URL you will see above the data for the Firebase Realtime Database.
